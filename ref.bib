abstract = {Product lifecycle management (PLM) aims to seamlessly manage all products and information and knowledge generated throughout the product lifecycle for achieving business competitiveness. Conventionally, PLM is implemented based on standalone and centralized systems provided by software vendors. The information of PLM is hardly to be integrated and shared among the cooperating parties. It is difficult to meet the requirements of the openness, interoperability and decentralization of the Industry 4.0 era. To address these challenges, this paper proposed an industrial blockchain-based PLM framework to facilitate the data exchange and service sharing in the product lifecycle. Firstly, we proposed the concept of industrial blockchain as the use of blockchain technology in the industry with the integration of IoT, M2M, and efficient consensus algorithms. It provided an open but secured information storage and exchange platform for the multiple stakeholders to achieve the openness, interoperability and decentralization in era of industry 4.0. Secondly, we proposed and developed customized blockchain information service to fulfill the connection between a single node with the blockchain network. As a middleware, it can not only process the multi-source and heterogeneous data from varied stages in the product lifecycle, but also broadcast the processed data to the blockchain network. Moreover, smart contract is used to automate the alert services in the product lifecycles. Finally, we illustrated the blockchain-based application between the cooperating partners in four emerging product lifecycle stages, including co-design and co-creation, quick and accurate tracking and tracing, proactive maintenance, and regulated recycling. A simulation experiment demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework. The results showed that the proposed framework is scalable and efficient, and hence it is feasible to be adopted in industry. With the successful development of the proposed platform, it is promising to provide an effective PLM for improving interoperability and cooperation between stakeholders in the entire product lifecycle.},

Cloud- Based Manufacturing is a recent on-demand model of manufacturing that is leveraging IoT technologies. While Cloud-Based Manufacturing enables on-demand access to manufacturing resources, a trusted intermediary is required for transactions between the users who wish to avail manufacturing services. We present a decentralized, peer-to-peer platform called BPIIoT for Industrial Internet of Things based on the Block chain technology. With the use of Blockchain technology, the BPIIoT platform enables peers in a decentralized, trustless, peer-to-peer network to interact with each other without the need for a trusted intermediary.},

abstract = {About a decade ago the fundamental operating principle of the Blockchain was introduced. It took several years before the technology gained widespread recognition in industry and academic communities outside of the computer science sphere. Since then many academic communities have taken up the topic, but so far no well-defined research agenda has emerged: research topics are scattered and rigorous approaches are scarce. More often than not, use cases implemented by industry apply a trial and error approach and there exists a dearth of theory-based academic papers on the topic following robust methodologies. Being a nascent research topic, case studies on Blockchain applications are a suitable approach to systematically transfer industry experience into research agendas which benefit both theory development and testing as well as design science research. In this paper I offer guidelines and suggestions on how to design and structure Blockchain case studies to create value for academia and the industry. More specifically, I describe Blockchain characteristics and challenges, present existing Blockchain case studies, and discuss various types of case study research and how they can be useful for industry and academic research.

abstract = {Through the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), a smart factory has entered the boom period expecting significant investments. In this new environment, Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication has shown immediate potential in IIoT applications. However, most M2M communication implementations use the centralized model in which it requires a reliable intermediary for transactions between machines. Using smart contracts in M2M communication would allow a decentralized network to be used without the need for a trusted intermediary. In order to provide security, privacy, and decentralization in M2M communication and IIoT processes, a middleware based on a smart contract is proposed. Such a proposal is analyzed at the industrial level and evaluated for impacts against the stringent communication requirements that industrial applications require. Experimental results show that the application of smart contracts offers greater security and privacy than traditional proposals, but time requirements of real-time systems must still be optimized for smart contracts to be applied at the industrial field.},

abstract = {With Industry 4.0, IT infrastructure has started to be used more effectively in the manufacturing sector. Cyber physical systems, IoT, cloud manufacturing, big data are some of the technologies that make up the concept of Industry 4.0. These technologies have solved many problems in the manufacturing sector. One of these technologies, cloud manufacturing technology, has emerged with the idea of pay as you go. This technology has enabled manufacturing resources to be leased and shared on a global scale. However, it has problems arising from its central structure and the need for a reliable 3rd party. Reliability, security, continuity, scalability, data lock-in, single point failure, data manipulation are some of the main problems. Blockchain (BC) is a decentralized and distributed technology. The data stored on the BC network cannot be altered in any way. With these features, we believe that BC-supported cloud manufacturing systems can overcome the aforementioned problems and eliminates the need for a reliable 3rd party. Based on this belief, in this study the agreements and communication between the resource provider and the customer, which is one of the basic functions of cloud manufacturing platforms, are realized with a decentralized application using BC-based smart contracts (SCs). The designed application is called the decentralized cloud manufacturing application (DCMApp). DCMApp does not operate on a fully public BC network, it has a hybrid structure and uses the Ethereum network as a public BC network. These features make DCMApp different from other BC-based cloud manufacturing applications. DCMApp's hybrid structure has enabled more transparent, economic and safe manufacturing agreements. It is also possible to store agreements on the BC network at a low cost without installing any server infrastructure. The use of Ethereum network makes it almost impossible to manipulate agreements.},

abstract = {New emerging manufacturing paradigms such as cloud manufacturing, IoT enabled manufacturing and service-oriented manufacturing, have brought many advantages to the manufacturing industry and metamorphosis the industrial IT infrastructure. However, all existing paradigms still suffer from the main problem related to centralized industrial network and third part trust operation. In a nutshell, centralized networking has had issues with flexibility, efficiency, availability, and security. Therefore, the main aim of this paper is to present a distributed peer to peer network architecture that improves the security and scalability of the CMfg. The proposed architecture was developed based on blockchain technology, this facilitated the development of a distributed peer to peer network with high security, scalability and a well-structured cloud system. The proposed architecture which was named as the “BCmfg” is made up of five layers namely; resource layer, perception layer, manufacturing layer, infrastructure layer and application layer. In this paper, the concept of its architecture, secure data sharing, and typical characteristic are discussed and investigated as well as the key technologies required for the implementation of this proposed architecture is explained based on demonstrative case study. The proposed architecture is explained based on a case study which contains five service providers and 15 end users with considering 32 OnCloud services. For evaluation purpose, the qualitative and quantitative methods are utilized and the results show that the proposed methodology can bring more advantages to CMfg than the security and scalability.},

abstract = {Blockchain is experiencing rapid development and has the full potential of revolutionizing the IoT platform in the industrial field. In this paper, a light-weighted Blockchain-based platform for IIoT is presented to address security, trust, and island connection problem in the process of IIoT ecosystem construction. BPIIoT is comprised of the on-chain network and the off-chain network. All transactions are processed in the on-chain network such as including digital signature based on access control and programmable permission. The off-chain network deals with the storage, complex data processing, and other problems that blockchain cannot solve. The smart contract is utilized as the service contract of consumers and manufacture resources, providing on-demand manufacturing service. Two smart application cases, manufacturing equipment data sharing and maintenance service sharing from smart manufacturing, are implemented to explain the smart contract for equipment maintenance service and status data sharing service throughout maintenance, repair, and operation service network by the BPIIoT.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to explore applications of blockchain technology related to the 4th Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0) and to present an example where blockchain is employed to facilitate machine-to-machine (M2M) interactions and establish a M2M electricity market in the context of the chemical industry. The presented scenario includes two electricity producers and one electricity consumer trading with each other over a blockchain. All participants are supplied with realistic data produced by process flow sheet models. This work contributes a proof-of-concept implementation of the scenario. Additionally, this paper describes and discusses the research and application landscape of blockchain technology in relation to the Industry 4.0. It concludes that this technology has significant under-researched potential to support and enhance the efficiency gains of the revolution and identifies areas for future research.},

@article{Angrish2018a,
abstract = {With product customization an emerging business opportunity, organizations must find ways to collaborate and enable sharing of information in an inherently trust-less network. In this paper, we propose - "FabRec": a decentralized approach to handle manufacturing information generated by various organizations using blockchain technology. We propose a system in which a decentralized network of manufacturing machines and computing nodes can enable automated transparency of an organization's capability, third party verification of such capability through a trail of past historic events and automated mechanisms to drive paperless contracts between participants using 'smart contracts'. Our system decentralizes critical information about the manufacturer and makes it available on a peer-to-peer network composed of fiduciary nodes to ensure transparency and data provenance through a verifiable audit trail. We present a testbed platform through a combination of manufacturing machines, system-on-chip platforms and computing nodes to demonstrate mechanisms through which a consortium of disparate organizations can communicate through a decentralized network. Our prototype testbed demonstrates the value of computer code residing on a decentralized network for verification of information on the blockchain and ways in which actions can be autonomously initiated in the physical world. This paper intends to expose system elements in preparation for much larger field tests through the working prototype and discusses the future potential of blockchain for manufacturing IT.},

@article{Pustisek2018,
abstract = {There are several distributed ledger protocols potentially suitable for the Internet of things (IoT), including the Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric and IOTA. This paper briefly presents and compares them from the IoT application development perspective. The IoT applications based on blockchain (BC) can incorporate the on-chain logic -the smart contracts- and Web, mobile or embedded client front-end application parts. We present three possible architectures for the IoT front-end BC applications. They differ in positioning of Ethereum blockchain clients (local device, remote server) and in positioning of key store needed for the management of outgoing transactions. The practical constraints of these architectures, which utilize the Ethereum network for trusted transaction exchange, are the data volumes, the location and synchronization of the full blockchain node and the location and the access to the Ethereum key store. Results of these experiments indicate that a full Ethereum node is not likely to reliably run on a constrained IoT devices. Therefore the architecture with remote Ethereum clients seems to be a viable approach, where two sub-options exist and differ in key store location/management. In addition, we proposed the use of architectures with a proprietary communication between the IoT device and remote blockchain client to further reduce the network traffic and enhance security. We expect it to be able to operate over low-power, low-bitrate mobile technologies, too. Our research clarifies differences in architectural approaches, but final decision for a particular ledger protocol and front-end application architecture is at strongly based on the particular intended use case.},
